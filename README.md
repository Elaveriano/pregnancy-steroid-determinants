# Urinary Steroidomics in Pregnancy
Analysis of urinary sex steroid metabolites during late pregnancy in two Spanish cohorts.

Code and analysis scripts for the study:  
**“Mapping of determinants of urinary sex steroid metabolites during late pregnancy: Results from two Spanish cohorts”**

##  Overview
This repository contains the scripts used to analyze urinary sex steroid metabolites in two Spanish pregnancy cohorts (BiSC and INMA-Sabadell).  
The code reproduces the main results described in the manuscript submitted to the *International Journal of Molecular Sciences* (Special Issue: *New Perspectives in Steroidomics*).
